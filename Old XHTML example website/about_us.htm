<h2>Who are 'The Poisoned Pears'?</h2>

<p>We 'The Poisoned Pears' are a (currently unsigned) indie rock/pop band mostly based in West-Sussex, England. Although all of us are currently at university, the band is available for hire during academic holidays. The details for hire can be found on the 'Contact us' section of the site.

<h2>A brief history</h2>

<p> We have been gigging and writing music together since we finished forming the band in mid 2004. Previously, under the name 'Mica', we performed at several school events and managed to win the Worth School 2004 Battle of the Bands. Since then we have evolved somewhat as musicians, and now have adopted a style a lot more upbeat and catchy than before. Primarily our influences are bands and artists like Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Coldplay, Bob Dylan, The Beatles and The Kooks (the latter three more than the former so these days). In the past we have learned a pretty reasonable selection of popular songs, and so are quite capable of providing an ear-pleasing and moving show for anyone that wants to hire us. Not only have we learned other people's songs, but we have worked extensively on songs of our own and are in the process of revising and improving the best ones for inclusion on an album that we hope to start recording sometime in the next year. Samples of this work in progress can be found on the 'Listen' section of this site, as well as The Poisoned Pears Myspace webpage (the link to which is at the bottom of this page).
